# Weakly Supervised Segmentation Framework Comparison

This repository contains code for comparing different weakly supervised segmentation frameworks utilizing pseudo-masks generated by various Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods.

## Experimental Workflow

### Step 1: Finetune ResNet-50

Navigate to the CAM comparison directory and fine-tune the ResNet-50 model:

```bash
cd MRP/cam_comparison
python train_classifier.py
```

### Step 2: Generate CAM for the Training Set

After training the classifier, generate Class Activation Maps (CAM) for the training dataset:

```bash
python generate_cam.py
```

### Step 3: Train U-Net with Pseudo-Labels

Train the U-Net segmentation model using the pseudo-labels created from CAM:

```bash
python train_segmentor.py
```

### Step 4: Generate and Evaluate the Trained Segmentor

Finally, generate segmentation results and evaluate the performance:

```bash
python generate_evaluate_segmentor.py
```
