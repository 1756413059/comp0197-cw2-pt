# Weakly Supervised Segmentation Framework Comparison

This repository contains code for comparing different weakly supervised segmentation frameworks utilizing pseudo-masks generated by various Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods.

## Experimental Workflow

Run the following code, this contains the following steps:

```bash
cd MRP/cam_comparison
python main.py
```

### Step 1: 

Navigate to the CAM comparison directory and download data:

### Step 2: Finetune ResNet-50

Fine-tune the ResNet-50 model using the dataset:

### Step 3: Generate CAM for the Training Set

After training the classifier, generate Class Activation Maps (CAM) for the training dataset:

### Step 4: Train U-Net with Pseudo-Labels

Train the U-Net segmentation model using the pseudo-labels created from CAM:

### Step 5: Generate and Evaluate the Trained Segmentor

Finally, generate segmentation results and evaluate the performance:
