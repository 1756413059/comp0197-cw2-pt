# Grad-CAM-based Psuedo Labels Generation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS)

This section implements a grad-CAM algorithm as well as its novel variant **SuppressCAM**, for psuedo labels generation in WSSS. 

## Method: SuppressCAM  
We propose **SuppressCAM**, a simple workflow to visualize feature suppression in neural networks by:  
1. Computing Grad-CAM with negated gradients for false classes.  
2. Aggregating via element-wise max pooling.  
SuppressCAM identifies the features that most suppress false classes, thereby generating more comprehensive object localization maps.

## ðŸ§ª Notes

- Supports mobilenet_v3_small or ResNet18 for classification
- Uses grad-CAM and negative grad-CAM for localization
