Instructions for Running main.py
===============================
To train the U-Net model with fully-supervised ground-truth masks:

python main.py

This will:
- Train the model for 25 epochs
- Save model weights to checkpoints/fully_supervised.pth
- Evaluate the model on validation and test sets

How to Run Evaluation Only (Optional)
-------------------------------------
You can evaluate a trained model by running:

python scripts/evaluate_supervised.py

Ensure the model path (fully_supervised.pth) exists and is correctly set in the script.

Additional Notes
----------------
- Masks should be generated using the provided preprocessing script (e.g., make_gt_masks.py).
- Predicted masks can be saved using scripts/predict.py.
