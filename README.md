## 📌 Projects

### 🧠 MRP: Weakly-supervised Pet Segmentation

- Location: `MRP/resnet-cam-unet/`
- A complete weakly-supervised semantic segmentation pipeline using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.
- Uses ResNet18 for classification, CAM for localization, and UNet for segmentation.
- See the [MRP README](MRP/resnet-cam-unet/README.md) for full details.

### 🧪 OEQ: Open-Ended Question (Optional / In Progress)

- Location: `OEQ/`
